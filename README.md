## Weather Sample

To use this, please sign up for an `openWeatherMap` API key and put it in the `keys.js` keys object.

Branches:

1. `hook-api-final` - The final hook that appears in the blog post.

2. `master` - A version that calls `getWeather` from within the component. It also includes an additional API call to gather the city name.

3. `everything-inline` - The first version of the hook from the blog post.

Thanks for reading!
